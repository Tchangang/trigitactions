- runworkflow: Run a workflow on github actions
- listworflow: List for a given repository all worklow.id, worklow.name and worklow.filename

##Commands
###Auth
To interact with Github api, you need to setup an env variable with a github token value.
You can generate a token there: https://github.com/settings/tokens

###listworkflow
This command helps you to list all workflow in a repository.
````javascript
listworkflow -o Owner -r Repository -p Profile -q search_term
````
Owner and Repository are required.

Profile is not required, but you need to setup an env variable named TRIGIT_DEFAULT_PROFILE with a valid github token.
If your already have an env variable with a valid github token value, just use:
```javascript
-p YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE_NAME
```

If you are looking for a particular workflow, you can use the -q parameter. It's a simple filter as workflow.name.toLowerCase().includes(q).

Example
````javascript
listworkflow -o JohnDoe -r FirstCorp
----------------------------------------
Output:
Owner: JohnDoe | Repo: FirstCorp
Workflow found: 3
id: 1637264 | name: Build/company1 | filename: buildcompany1.yml
id: 6173621 | name: Build/company2 | filename: buildcompany2.yml

````javascript
runworkflow  -o Owner -r Repository -w WorkflowId -i 'DataForJob:JSON' -f master
